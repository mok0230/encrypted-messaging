# Encrypted Messaging

## Motivation

I've recently become intrigued with on-chain encrypted messaging. I think there are a ton of potential applications for this. For one, it's easy to directly integrate direct messaging into any dapp without any need for integration with 3rd party tooling. 


## Resources

The missing link is that you would need wallets to be able to execute a decrypt operation. There was an EIP that died on the vine a few years ago: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1098

Someone picked up the torch more recently, but there hasn't been any activity for 3 months: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2845
